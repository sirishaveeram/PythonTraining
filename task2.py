(Q1.) Write a program in Python to perform the following operation:
If a number is divisible by 3 it should print “Consultadd” as a string
x = int(input("Enter a value:"))
if x % 3==0:
    print("Consultadd")
else:
    print("value is not divisable by 3")
If a number is divisible by 5 it should print “Python Training” as a string
x = int(input("Enter a value:"))
if x % 5==0:

    print("Python Training")
else:
    print("value is not divisable by 5")

If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should print “Consultadd - Python Training” as a string.
x = int(input("Enter a value:"))
if x % 3==0  and x % 5==0:

    print("“Consultadd - Python Training”")
else:
    print("value is not divisable by 3 and 5")
